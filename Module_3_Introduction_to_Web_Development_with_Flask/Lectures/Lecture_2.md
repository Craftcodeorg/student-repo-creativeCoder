# Lecture Title: Creating Routes and Handling Requests

## 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the concept of routes in Flask and how they are used to handle HTTP requests.
- Create basic routes for a Flask application.
- Handle different types of requests (GET, POST) and respond appropriately.

## 2. Introduction:
In web development, routing is a fundamental concept that defines how an application responds to client requests. In Flask, routes are the pathways that connect a userâ€™s request to the corresponding function in your application. This is crucial for any Python Developer, as it allows you to build interactive web applications that can serve dynamic content.

For someone interested in Formula 1 Racing, imagine creating a web application that displays race statistics or tracks live race data. Understanding how to create routes and handle requests will empower you to develop applications that can analyze and visualize F1 data in real-time, enhancing your skills as a Python Developer.

## 3. Core Concepts:
### 3.1 What are Routes?
- **Definition**: A route is a URL pattern that is associated with a specific function in your Flask application.
- **Example**: When a user visits `http://yourapp.com/race`, the application knows to execute the function that handles race data.

### 3.2 Creating Routes
- **Syntax**: Use the `@app.route()` decorator to define a route.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/race')
    def show_race():
        return "Welcome to the F1 Race Page!"
    ```

### 3.3 Handling Requests
- **GET Requests**: Used to retrieve data from the server.
- **POST Requests**: Used to send data to the server (e.g., submitting race results).
- **Example**:
    ```python
    from flask import request

    @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
    def submit_data():
        data = request.form['data']
        return f"Data received: {data}"
    ```

## 4. Practical Application:
### Real-World Example:
Imagine you are developing an application for F1 fans where they can submit their predictions for race outcomes. You will need routes to display the prediction form and to handle the submission of predictions.

### Simple Code Snippet:
```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['GET'])
def predict():
    return '''
        <form method="POST" action="/submit">
            <input type="text" name="prediction" placeholder="Your prediction">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
    '''
```
This snippet creates a simple form where users can submit their predictions, demonstrating how routes can be used for both displaying and processing data.

## 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we covered the essential concepts of creating routes and handling requests in Flask. Key takeaways include:
- Understanding what routes are and how they function within a Flask application.
- The ability to create routes using decorators and handle different types of HTTP requests.
These skills are vital for your progress as a Python Developer, especially as you aim to create applications related to Formula 1 Racing and other data-driven projects.

## 6. Next Steps:
In our next lecture, we will explore how to render templates in Flask, allowing us to create more dynamic and visually appealing web pages. To prepare, consider looking into HTML basics, as this will help you understand how to structure your web pages effectively.
