# Lecture: Connecting to Databases Using SQLAlchemy

## 1. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:
- Understand the role of SQLAlchemy in Flask applications.
- Connect a Flask application to a database using SQLAlchemy.
- Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQLAlchemy.
- Recognize how these skills can be applied in the context of Formula 1 Racing and finance-related applications.

## 2. Introduction
Connecting to databases is a fundamental skill for any Python Developer, especially when building web applications that require data storage and retrieval. SQLAlchemy is a powerful ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that simplifies database interactions in Python. 

For a learner interested in Formula 1 Racing and data analysis, mastering SQLAlchemy is crucial for developing applications that analyze race data or manage investment portfolios effectively. This lecture will equip you with the knowledge to seamlessly integrate databases into your Flask applications, paving the way for creating interactive dashboards and automating stock market analysis.

## 3. Core Concepts
### 3.1 What is SQLAlchemy?
- **Definition**: SQLAlchemy is an ORM that allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries.
- **Benefits**: It abstracts the complexities of database interactions, making it easier to manage data.

### 3.2 Setting Up SQLAlchemy in Flask
- **Installation**: Use pip to install SQLAlchemy:
  ```bash
  pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
  ```
- **Configuration**: Integrate SQLAlchemy with your Flask app:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

  app = Flask(__name__)
  app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
  db = SQLAlchemy(app)
  ```

### 3.3 Defining Models
- **Creating Models**: Define your data structure using classes:
  ```python
  class RaceData(db.Model):
      id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
      race_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
      lap_time = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
  ```

### 3.4 Performing CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new race data:
  ```python
  new_race = RaceData(race_name='Monaco Grand Prix', lap_time=1.12)
  db.session.add(new_race)
  db.session.commit()
  ```
- **Read**: Query race data:
  ```python
  races = RaceData.query.all()
  ```
- **Update**: Modify existing race data:
  ```python
  race_to_update = RaceData.query.get(1)
  race_to_update.lap_time = 1.10
  db.session.commit()
  ```
- **Delete**: Remove race data:
  ```python
  race_to_delete = RaceData.query.get(1)
  db.session.delete(race_to_delete)
  db.session.commit()
  ```

## 4. Practical Application
In the world of Formula 1 Racing, teams often analyze vast amounts of data from races to improve performance. By connecting a Flask application to a database using SQLAlchemy, developers can create tools that:
- Store historical race data for analysis.
- Track lap times and visualize trends over seasons.

### Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up a database and add a new race entry:
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///f1_races.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Race(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    lap_time = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)

@app.route('/add_race/<name>/<lap_time>')
def add_race(name, lap_time):
    new_race = Race(name=name, lap_time=lap_time)
    db.session.add(new_race)
    db.session.commit()
    return f"Race {name} added!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## 5. Summary
In this lecture, we explored how to connect a Flask application to a database using SQLAlchemy. We covered the importance of SQLAlchemy for managing data through models and performing CRUD operations. These skills are essential for any aspiring Python Developer looking to build applications in finance or sports analytics.

## 6. Next Steps
In the next lecture, we will delve into advanced querying techniques with SQLAlchemy, enabling you to extract meaningful insights from your data. To prepare, consider reviewing the basics of SQL queries and thinking about what types of data you would like to analyze in your own projects related to Formula 1 Racing or stock market trends.
