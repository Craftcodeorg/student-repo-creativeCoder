### Module Title: Introduction to Web Development with Flask

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement:
As a budding Python Developer with a passion for Formula 1 Racing, your task is to create a Flask application that displays race results from an API. This application will allow users to view the latest race results dynamically. You will utilize Jinja2 templating to render the HTML pages and make the data visually appealing and organized.

**Scenario**: You are tasked with building an interactive dashboard for a healthcare organization that wants to analyze the performance of F1 drivers as part of a health and fitness initiative. The dashboard should display the race results fetched from a mock API, showcasing how athletes perform under pressure and their recovery times.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/race_results')
def race_results():
    # Fetch race results from a mock API
    response = requests.get('https://api.mockrace.com/results')  # Replace with actual API endpoint
    results = response.json()  # Parse JSON response

    # Render the HTML template with the race results
    return render_template('results.html', results=results)

# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts
def calculate_recovery_time(race_time, recovery_factor):
    # Calculate recovery time by applying a recovery factor to the race time
    recovery_time = _______ * _______  # Fill in the blanks
    return recovery_time

# Test the function with example values
print(calculate_recovery_time(90, 1.5))  # Example values in minutes
```

#### 3. Hints:
- To complete the `calculate_recovery_time` function, remember that recovery time can be calculated by multiplying the race time by a recovery factor that indicates how much longer it takes for an athlete to recover after a strenuous activity.
- Think about how you can use the `results` variable passed to the template to dynamically display each driver's performance on the web page.
- Make sure to handle any potential errors when fetching data from the API, such as checking if the response was successful.

#### 4. Expected Outcome:
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fetch race results from an API and display them using Jinja2 templates.
- Utilize Python functions to perform calculations related to race performance and recovery.
- Ensure your application follows best practices, including error handling and clear documentation through comments.
- Create an engaging and interactive web application that aligns with your interests in Formula 1 Racing and your career goals in Python development.

### Integration
