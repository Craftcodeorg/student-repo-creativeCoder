### Module Title: Data Structures and Collections in Python

#### Assignment Description
**Assignment**: Build a program that analyzes lap times from multiple races and stores them in a dictionary.

---

### Problem Statement
Create a function that analyzes lap times for Formula 1 cars, using the techniques discussed in the lecture. The function should calculate the average lap time and identify any laps where the time exceeded the average by more than 10%. This analysis will help in understanding performance trends, which can be crucial for making strategic decisions in racing.

---

### Starter Code
```python
# Starter code for analyzing race lap times

def analyze_lap_times(lap_times):
    # Step 1: Calculate the average lap time
    avg_time = sum(lap_times) / len(lap_times)
    
    # Step 2: Identify laps that exceed the average by more than 10%
    slow_laps = []
    for time in lap_times:
        if time > avg_time * 1.1:
            slow_laps.append(time)
    
    # Return results (students will need to format the output)
    return avg_time, slow_laps

# Test the function with sample data
lap_times = [90.2, 91.5, 89.8, 95.0, 92.3]
average, slow_laps = analyze_lap_times(lap_times)
print(f"Average Lap Time: {average}")
print(f"Laps Exceeding 10% Over Average: {slow_laps}")
```

---

### Detailed Instructions
1. **Modify the Function**:
   - Update the `analyze_lap_times` function to also return a list of lap numbers (indices) where the time exceeded the average by more than 10%. 
   - Hint: You can use the `enumerate()` function to get both the index and value while iterating through `lap_times`.

2. **Enhance Output**:
   - Format the output to include detailed feedback to the user. For example, indicate how much each slow lap exceeded the average time.
   - Consider returning a dictionary that includes:
     - The average lap time.
     - A list of slow laps with their respective indices and how much they exceeded the average.

3. **Test Your Function**:
   - Use different sets of sample data to ensure your function works correctly across various scenarios.
   - For example, test with lap times that include both fast and slow laps to see if it accurately identifies the slow ones.

### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
**Success Criteria**:
- The function correctly calculates the average lap time and identifies slow laps.
- The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- The output is formatted in a clear and user-friendly manner, providing detailed insights into the lap times.

**Evaluation Rubric**:
- **Functionality (50%)**: The program performs all required calculations and outputs correct results.
- **Code Quality (30%)**: The code is well-organized, properly commented, and follows Python coding standards.
- **User Feedback (20%)**: The output is informative and easy to understand, enhancing user experience.
