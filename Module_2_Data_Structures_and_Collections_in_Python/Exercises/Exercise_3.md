### Module Title: Data Structures and Collections in Python

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   Create a program that counts the occurrences of each car color in a list of cars used in Formula 1 races. The program should help analyze the distribution of car colors among different teams, which can be crucial for branding and marketing strategies in the racing industry.

   **Scenario**: You are tasked with analyzing the car colors of the teams participating in the latest Formula 1 season. You have a list of car colors, and you need to write a program that counts how many times each color appears. This information will be beneficial for understanding the popularity of certain colors among teams.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is a starter code snippet that you need to complete. Fill in the blanks to implement the functionality of counting car colors.

   ```python
   # Starter code for counting occurrences of car colors
   def count_car_colors(car_colors):
       # Create an empty dictionary to store color counts
       color_count = {}
       
       # Iterate over each color in the list
       for color in car_colors:
           # If the color is already in the dictionary, increment its count
           if color in color_count:
               color_count[color] += 1
           # Otherwise, add the color to the dictionary with a count of 1
           else:
               color_count[color] = 1
       
       return color_count

   # Example list of car colors from F1 teams
   car_colors_list = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Red']

   # Call the function and print the result
   print(count_car_colors(______))  # Fill in the blank with the appropriate variable
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Think about how you can use a dictionary to keep track of counts for each unique color.
   - Remember that you can use a `for` loop to iterate through each item in a list.
   - Consider how you can check if a key exists in a dictionary and update its value accordingly.
   - Use the example list provided to test your function once you've completed it.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   After filling in the blanks and running your code, you should see output that displays the count of each car color, such as:
   ```
   {'Red': 3, 'Blue': 2, 'Green': 1, 'Yellow': 1}
   ```
   This output demonstrates your understanding of iteration, dictionary usage, and real-world application related to Formula 1 racing.

### Integration
- Ensure that the exercise content is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting to enhance readability.
- Include any necessary files or resources as links to support learners as they work through this exercise. 

By completing this exercise, you will reinforce your understanding of iteration over data structures in Python while applying your knowledge to a practical scenario related to your interests in Formula 1 racing.
