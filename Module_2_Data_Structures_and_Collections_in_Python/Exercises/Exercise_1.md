### Module Title: Data Structures and Collections in Python

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with creating a simple data management system for a healthcare application that tracks the locations of various Formula 1 race tracks. Your goal is to create a list of F1 race tracks and sort them alphabetically. This exercise will help you apply the concepts of lists, tuples, and dictionaries as discussed in the lecture.

   **Scenario**: Imagine that you are developing a healthcare program that provides health and safety information for individuals attending F1 races. You need to maintain a list of race tracks to ensure that emergency services are aware of the locations. Your task is to create a list of these tracks, sort them, and display them in a user-friendly format.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is a starter code snippet that you need to complete. Fill in the blanks to create a list of race tracks, sort them, and print the sorted list.

   ```python
   # Starter code for managing F1 race tracks
   def manage_race_tracks():
       # Create a list of F1 race tracks
       race_tracks = [______, ______, ______]  # Fill in with track names
       
       # Sort the race tracks alphabetically
       race_tracks.sort()
       
       # Print the sorted list of race tracks
       print("Sorted F1 Race Tracks:")
       for track in race_tracks:
           print(track)

   # Call the function to execute the code
   manage_race_tracks()
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Think of popular F1 race tracks that you know. You can use names like "Monaco", "Silverstone", "Monza", etc.
   - Remember that lists in Python can be modified, so you can add or remove items after they have been created.
   - To sort a list, you can use the `.sort()` method, which organizes the items in alphabetical order.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
   - Create a list of F1 race tracks and fill in the blanks correctly.
   - Sort the list alphabetically using the appropriate Python methods.
   - Display the sorted list in a clear and readable format.
   
   Your final output should look something like this (depending on your input):
   ```
   Sorted F1 Race Tracks:
   Monaco
   Monza
   Silverstone
   ```

### Integration
- Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain each step you take. This will not only help you understand your logic but also make it easier for others to read your code.
- Use markdown formatting for clarity when documenting your exercise solutions or sharing them in community projects.

This exercise is designed to reinforce your understanding of Python data structures while aligning with your interests in Formula 1 Racing and your career goals as a Python Developer in the healthcare industry. Happy coding!
