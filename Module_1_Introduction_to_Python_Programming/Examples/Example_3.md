# Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming

## 1. Introduction
In this section, we will discuss **Example 3: Implementing a simple calculator function**. This example builds upon the core concepts covered in our previous lecture on basic syntax and data types in Python. Understanding how to create a simple calculator function is crucial for automating calculations in various fields, including healthcare. For instance, healthcare professionals often need to perform calculations related to dosages, BMI (Body Mass Index), or patient statistics. A simple calculator function can streamline these processes, making them more efficient and reducing the chance of human error.

## 2. Code Snippet
Below is a well-commented code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a simple calculator function in Python. This function can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python
# Simple Calculator Function

def calculator(num1, num2, operation):
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, and division.
    
    Parameters:
    num1 (float): The first number.
    num2 (float): The second number.
    operation (str): The operation to perform ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide').
    
    Returns:
    float: The result of the arithmetic operation.
    """
    try:
        if operation == 'add':
            return num1 + num2
        elif operation == 'subtract':
            return num1 - num2
        elif operation == 'multiply':
            return num1 * num2
        elif operation == 'divide':
            if num2 == 0:
                raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
            return num1 / num2
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid operation. Choose from 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.")
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

# Example usage of the calculator function
result = calculator(10, 5, 'add')
print(f"Result of addition: {result}")
```

## 3. Explanation
This code defines a function called `calculator` that takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

- **Function Definition**: The function starts with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.
  
- **Docstring**: The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose and parameters.

- **Try-Except Block**: This block is used for error handling. It allows the program to handle exceptions gracefully without crashing.

- **Conditional Statements**: The function uses `if-elif` statements to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the `operation` parameter.

- **Division by Zero Check**: Before performing division, the function checks if `num2` is zero and raises a `ValueError` if it is, preventing a division error.

- **Return Statement**: The result of the operation is returned. If an invalid operation is provided, an error message is returned instead.

- **Example Usage**: At the end of the snippet, an example shows how to call the calculator function and print the result.

## 4. Application in Healthcare
In healthcare, a simple calculator function can be applied in various scenarios. For example:

- **Dosage Calculations**: Healthcare professionals can use this calculator to determine medication dosages based on patient weight or age. For instance, if a medication requires a specific dosage per kilogram of body weight, this function can quickly compute the total dosage needed for a patient.

- **BMI Calculation**: The calculator can be modified to include a BMI calculation function that takes weight and height as inputs and returns the BMI value. This is essential for assessing whether a patient is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

- **Statistical Analysis**: The calculator can assist in performing quick statistical analyses on patient data, such as calculating averages or percentages for health metrics.

By integrating such functions into healthcare applications or tools, professionals can enhance their efficiency and accuracy in performing critical calculations, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.
