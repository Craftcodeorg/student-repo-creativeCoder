# Module Title: Introduction to Python Programming

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement:
Create a program that checks if a given lap time (in seconds) from a Formula 1 race is even or odd. This program will help you analyze lap times and could be a preliminary step in determining patterns in race performance. Use the concepts covered in the lecture to set up your Python environment and write the program.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
```python
# Starter code for checking if a lap time is even or odd
def is_even_or_odd(lap_time):
    # Check if lap_time is even or odd
    if _______ % 2 == 0:
        return "The lap time is even."
    else:
        return "The lap time is odd."

# Test the function with an example lap time
print(is_even_or_odd(______))  # Replace with a lap time in seconds
```

### 3. Hints:
- Remember that an even number divided by 2 leaves no remainder.
- You can test your function using various lap times, such as 78 seconds (which is even) or 79 seconds (which is odd).
- Ensure you use the correct variable name for the lap time you pass to the function.

### 4. Expected Outcome:
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to use conditional statements in Python. The final solution should look like this:

```python
# Starter code for checking if a lap time is even or odd
def is_even_or_odd(lap_time):
    # Check if lap_time is even or odd
    if lap_time % 2 == 0:
        return "The lap time is even."
    else:
        return "The lap time is odd."

# Test the function with an example lap time
print(is_even_or_odd(78))  # Example output: The lap time is even.
```

This exercise will help reinforce the concepts learned in the lecture while also connecting to your specific interests in Formula 1 Racing. You will practice using basic Python syntax and control structures, which are essential skills for your journey as a Python Developer.
