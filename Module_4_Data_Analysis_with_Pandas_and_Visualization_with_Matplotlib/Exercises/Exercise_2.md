# Module Title: Data Analysis with Pandas and Visualization with Matplotlib

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with analyzing lap times from a recent Formula 1 race to compare the performance of different drivers. Your goal is to create visualizations that highlight the differences in lap times, identify any trends, and provide insights into the drivers' performances. This exercise will require you to apply the data cleaning and preprocessing techniques discussed in the lecture.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code template that you will need to complete. Fill in the blanks to ensure the code functions correctly and adheres to best practices for data analysis using Pandas.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset containing lap times for different drivers
df = pd.read_csv('f1_lap_times.csv')

# Check for missing values and fill them with the mean lap time
df['lap_time'].fillna(_____, inplace=True)  # Fill in with mean lap time

# Remove duplicate entries to maintain data integrity
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Standardize date format for consistent analysis
df['race_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['race_date'])

# Group by driver and calculate average lap time
average_lap_times = df.groupby('driver')['lap_time'].mean().reset_index()

# Visualize the average lap times using a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(average_lap_times['driver'], average_lap_times['lap_time'], color='blue')
plt.title('Average Lap Times of Different Drivers')
plt.xlabel('Drivers')
plt.ylabel('Average Lap Time (seconds)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 3. Hints
- To fill in the blank for the mean lap time, consider using the `mean()` function on the 'lap_time' column of your DataFrame.
- When grouping data by driver, remember to use the `groupby()` function followed by an aggregation method to calculate the average.
- For visualizing data, ensure you have imported Matplotlib and set up your plot's aesthetics (like title, labels, and colors) for better clarity.

### 4. Expected Outcome
Upon completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Successfully fill in the blanks in the provided starter code.
- Demonstrate an understanding of data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- Create a clear and informative bar plot that compares average lap times across different drivers.
- Comment on your code effectively, explaining each step of your data processing and visualization.

This exercise will help you practice essential data analysis skills relevant to both Formula 1 Racing and your future career as a Python Developer in Healthcare, where data accuracy and visualization are crucial for informed decision-making.
