### Assignment: Create a Report Summarizing Insights from Race Data Using Pandas

#### Problem Statement
In this assignment, you will analyze lap times from Formula 1 races to derive insights that could be relevant to performance evaluation in a healthcare context, such as understanding variability in patient treatment times. You will create a function that calculates the average lap time, identifies laps where the time exceeded the average by more than 10%, and generates a summary report of your findings.

#### Starter Code
Below is a basic code framework that you will expand upon. This code sets up the environment and includes comments to guide you on where to implement your solutions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Sample dataset: Lap times for different drivers across multiple races
data = {
    'Driver': ['Driver A', 'Driver B', 'Driver C', 'Driver A', 'Driver B', 'Driver C'],
    'Lap': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
    'Time': [90.2, 91.5, 89.8, 95.0, 92.3, 90.1]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def analyze_lap_times(df):
    """
    Analyze lap times to calculate average and identify slow laps.
    
    Parameters:
    df (DataFrame): DataFrame containing lap times
    
    Returns:
    tuple: average lap time and list of slow laps
    """
    # Step 1: Calculate the average lap time
    avg_time = df['Time'].mean()
    
    # Step 2: Identify laps that exceed the average by more than 10%
    slow_laps = df[df['Time'] > avg_time * 1.1]
    
    # Step 3: Return results (students will need to format the output)
    return avg_time, slow_laps

# Test the function with the sample data
average, slow_laps = analyze_lap_times(df)
print(f"Average Lap Time: {average}")
print("Laps Exceeding 10% Over Average:")
print(slow_laps)
```

#### Detailed Instructions
1. **Modify the Function**: Enhance the `analyze_lap_times` function to not only return the average time and slow laps but also a list of lap numbers where the time exceeded the average by more than 10%. Update the return statement accordingly.

2. **Enhance Output**: Improve the output to provide more detailed feedback to the user. For each slow lap, calculate and display the percentage by which it exceeded the average lap time.

3. **Visualize Results**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that show:
   - A line graph comparing lap times for each driver.
   - A bar chart displaying the number of laps exceeding the average time for each driver.

4. **Summarize Findings**: Write a brief summary report (in comments) that explains your findings from the analysis. Discuss what insights can be drawn from the data and how this could relate to performance evaluations in healthcare.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation
- **Functionality**: The function correctly calculates the average lap time and identifies slow laps.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- **Output Format**: The output is formatted in a clear and user-friendly manner.
- **Visualizations**: Appropriate visualizations are created that enhance understanding of the data.
- **Insightful Summary**: The summary report provides valuable insights based on the analysis.

This assignment encourages you to apply your knowledge of data analysis with Pandas and visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn while also relating it to real-world applications in healthcare. Good luck!
