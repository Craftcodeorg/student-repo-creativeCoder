### Assignment: Automate Stock Market Analysis and Visualize Trends Over Time

#### Problem Statement:
Create a program that automates the analysis of stock market data. The program should clean and preprocess the dataset, calculate key statistics, and visualize trends over time. The focus will be on ensuring data quality by addressing common issues such as missing values and duplicates, as discussed in the lecture. This assignment is particularly relevant to the healthcare industry, where financial data analysis can inform investment decisions.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework to get you started. You will need to complete the missing parts and enhance the functionality as outlined in the instructions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Starter code for analyzing stock market data

def analyze_stock_data(file_path):
    # Step 1: Load the dataset
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Step 2: Check for missing values
    print("Missing values before cleaning:\n", df.isnull().sum())

    # Step 3: Fill missing values with the mean of the column
    df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

    # Step 4: Remove duplicate entries
    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

    # Step 5: Standardize date format
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

    # Step 6: Calculate average closing price
    avg_close = df['Close'].mean()

    # Step 7: Identify days where closing price was above average
    above_avg_days = df[df['Close'] > avg_close]

    # Step 8: Visualize closing prices over time
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Close'], label='Closing Price')
    plt.axhline(y=avg_close, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Average Closing Price')
    plt.title('Stock Closing Prices Over Time')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Closing Price')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

    # Return results
    return avg_close, above_avg_days

# Test the function with sample data
file_path = 'stock_data.csv'  # Replace with your CSV file path
average_closing_price, high_days = analyze_stock_data(file_path)
print(f"Average Closing Price: {average_closing_price}")
print("Days with Closing Price Above Average:\n", high_days)
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Ensure you have a CSV file containing stock market data with at least 'Date' and 'Close' columns.
   - Modify the `file_path` variable to point to your dataset.

2. **Check for Missing Values**:
   - Use `df.isnull().sum()` to identify columns with missing values.
   - Implement a strategy to handle these missing values (e.g., filling with mean).

3. **Remove Duplicate Entries**:
   - Use `df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)` to ensure that your dataset is clean.

4. **Standardize Date Format**:
   - Convert the 'Date' column to a datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`.

5. **Calculate Average Closing Price**:
   - Calculate the average closing price and store it in a variable.

6. **Identify Days Above Average**:
   - Create a new DataFrame that contains only the rows where the closing price exceeds the average.

7. **Visualize Trends**:
   - Use Matplotlib to plot the closing prices over time.
   - Include a horizontal line representing the average closing price.

8. **Return Results**:
   - Ensure your function returns both the average closing price and the DataFrame of days with above-average closing prices.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Correctness**: The program should accurately clean the dataset, calculate the average closing price, and identify days above this average.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be well-organized, commented, and follow best practices.
- **Visualization**: The plot should be clear, with appropriate labels and legends, making it easy to understand trends in the data.
- **Documentation**: Provide a brief explanation of your approach and any assumptions made during your analysis.

This assignment will help you apply key concepts from the lecture on data cleaning and preprocessing while building practical skills relevant to stock market analysis in a healthcare context.
