# Module Title: Data Analysis with Pandas and Visualization with Matplotlib

## Example 2: Cleaning Missing Values in Datasets

### 1. Introduction
In the context of healthcare, cleaning and preprocessing data is critical for ensuring accurate patient outcomes and effective treatment plans. The lecture on "Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Techniques" equips learners with the skills to handle missing values, which is a common issue in healthcare datasets. For instance, missing patient records can lead to misdiagnoses or inadequate treatment. By mastering these techniques, you will be better prepared to analyze healthcare data effectively, leading to improved decision-making and patient care.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to clean missing values in a healthcare dataset using Pandas. This example assumes you have a dataset containing patient information, including age, weight, and height, where some values may be missing.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the healthcare dataset
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('healthcare_data.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The specified file was not found.")
    exit()

# Display initial data overview
print("Initial Data Overview:")
print(df.info())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing Values Count:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Fill missing 'age' with the mean age
if 'age' in df.columns:
    df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Fill missing 'weight' with the median weight
if 'weight' in df.columns:
    df['weight'].fillna(df['weight'].median(), inplace=True)

# Remove rows where 'height' is still missing
if 'height' in df.columns:
    df.dropna(subset=['height'], inplace=True)

# Display cleaned dataset overview
print("\nCleaned Data Overview:")
print(df.info())
```

### 3. Explanation
Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Importing Pandas**: The code begins by importing the Pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation.
  
2. **Loading the Dataset**: The `pd.read_csv()` function attempts to load the healthcare dataset. If the file is not found, an error message is printed, and the program exits gracefully.

3. **Initial Data Overview**: The `df.info()` method displays an overview of the dataset, including data types and non-null counts, helping to identify potential issues.

4. **Checking for Missing Values**: The `df.isnull().sum()` method counts the number of missing values in each column, providing insight into which fields need attention.

5. **Filling Missing Values**:
   - For the 'age' column, missing values are filled with the mean age using `fillna()`. This method helps maintain the overall distribution of ages.
   - For the 'weight' column, missing values are filled with the median weight, which is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.
   
6. **Removing Rows with Missing Height**: The `dropna()` method removes any rows where 'height' is still missing. This ensures that all remaining records have complete information for analysis.

7. **Final Data Overview**: Finally, `df.info()` is called again to show the cleaned dataset's structure, confirming that missing values have been addressed.

### 4. Application
In healthcare, cleaning missing values is vital for creating reliable patient profiles and ensuring accurate treatment decisions. For example, if a dataset includes patient weights that are missing, it could skew analyses related to medication dosages or health risk assessments. By filling in these gaps or removing incomplete records, healthcare professionals can ensure that their analyses reflect true patient conditions.

Moreover, clean datasets enable better predictive modeling for patient outcomes, leading to enhanced healthcare services. For instance, hospitals can use cleaned data to identify trends in patient demographics and health conditions, ultimately improving resource allocation and patient care strategies.

### Conclusion
This module has provided you with foundational skills in data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas, specifically focusing on handling missing values in healthcare datasets. By mastering these techniques, you will significantly enhance your ability to analyze data accurately, which is crucial for your goal of becoming a proficient Python Developer in the healthcare field.
